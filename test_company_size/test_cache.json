Illusion of Thinking: How AI in Recruitment Risks Flattening What Makes Hiring Human \\n\\nTwo of the best thinkers in our space come together for this episode that goes against the grain with Matt Buckland and Hung Lee\\n\\nTopics We’ll Cover:\\n\\nWhy much of AI in recruitment today is a solution in search of a problem.\\n\\nHow the pressure to adopt AI tools creates guilt among practitioners, even when businesses aren’t ready.\\n\\nGreat recruitment is idiosyncratic, not homogeneous.\\nThe risk of training AI on average data — leading to AI slop that pushes average candidates and filters out outliers.\\n\\nWhy flattening nuance removes the ability to surprise, delight, or differentiate.\\n\\nThe danger of treating recruitment as a transactional, administrative process vs a human-centered, high-impact function.\\n\\nAI as a force for homogenisation – efficient, but not effective for complex or strategic hires.\\n\\nThe double standard: we criticise candidates for using AI tools, while recruiters rely on them blindly.\\n\\nWhere trust becomes central: trust in the data, trust in the tools, trust in the people.\\n\\nWhere AI can be useful: with intentional design and focused problem-solving (e.g. solving for volume, low-variance hiring).\\n\\nThis episode won’t be about AI worship or bashing—it’s about nuance, critical thought, and practical implications for recruiters and orgs navigating this shift.\",\"url\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hackajob_the-illusion-of-thinking-how-ai-in-recruitment-activity-7388863761115262976-U_yf\"},{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"DiscussionForumPosting\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"hackajob\",\"url\":\"https://uk.linkedin.com/company/hackajob\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-11-05T11:31:48.130Z\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hackajob_were-live-today-join-hung-lee-matt-activity-7391799392501985281-uw4C\",\"text\":\"We’re

Today, women are seeking safety, authenticity, and depth in their dating lives more than ever and are prioritizing meaningful connections that align with their values and shared interests.\\n\\nAs we continue to innovate and better serve our community, we are excited to introduce these new features to foster safer and more compatible dating. \\n\\n💛 Connection Over Common Ground: According to Bumble’s research*, 91% of Gen-Z respondents shared that it is important for them to only see profiles of people that they have shared interests and values with. Discover is a new, personalized experience to meet people you are most compatible with -- showcasing relevant matches based on shared datings intentions, interests, and communities.\\n\\n💛 Peace of Mind When Meeting IRL: Bumble’s research shows 4 in 5 Gen-Z (80%) surveyed* are more likely to go on a date with someone who has their profile ID verified, and 78% agree that knowing who they are speaking to is who they say they are is critical in their decision to use a dating app. ID Verification allows members to verify their profile with ID, and Share Date allows members to share date details with a trusted contact outside of the app for added reassurance.\\n\\n💛 Continuing Kind Connections: 94% of those surveyed* shared it was important to make sure dating apps are doing their part to stop bad behavior online before it starts, and 94% agree it’s important to know their experience on a dating app will be respectful. The expansion of Review Before You Send to your chat messages reinforces our mission of Kind Connections and commitment to fostering a respectful and positive environment for all members.\\n\\nLearn more here: https://lnkd.in/e2njh69U. \\n\\n* Research commissioned by Bumble between February 20-28, 2025 of 2,501 people ages 18-35 in the U.S. who are actively using dating apps.\\n** Research was conducted by Bumble using internal polling between September 19 - 23, 2024 with a sample of 41,294 Bumble members between 18-35 around the world.\",\"url\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bumbleinc_were-excited-to-announce-the-launch-of-several-activity-7307385372706066432-hzKt\"},{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"DiscussionForumPosting\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Bumble Inc.\",\"url\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bumbleinc\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-03-04T15:51:14.939Z\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bumbleinc_runclubs-community-marketing-activity-7302717269460086784-2UQB\",\"text\":\"💡 According to our study with IPSOS, 69% of Spanish singles aged 18-26 would love to attend an event organized by a dating app.* The reason: it eliminates the awkward \\\"blank space\\\" and makes meeting people easier, taking the pressure off that first date.\\n\\nThat's why we recently partnered with the Barcelona Half Marathon, Europe’s second-largest half marathon (33K+ runners), to bring its community together. 🏃🏼‍♀️ \\n\\nFrom motivational Bumble quotes lining the course, including the Bumble Bridge near the finish, to the Bumble Café with Good News offering free coffee, good vibes, yellow flowers, and fun surprises, this was about more than just running -- it was about connection.
